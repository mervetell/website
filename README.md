# Website Part 1
I use some free templates as a guide and combine them and add new codes into the site, and I create whole new website. You can check out the link down below. I use HTML, CSS and PHP. I copied and gave reference JavaScript section. Any of Javascript or Bootstrap codes are not belong to me. I put them for not ruining integrity.

This files are first part of the website.
